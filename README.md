Introduction to Tableau

TABLEAU

Introduction. 
I installed Tableau in my PC with college student licence. 
I learned the name of the values on the left hand side are called, dimensions and below dimensions after the separation line, there are quantitative measures, Measureable data.
I used a Kaggle data set from the stock market. 
 
Unzipped the compressed txt file, and reviewed it first in excel, I added one head line missing, and remove irrelevant columns, did not modify format because Tableau would not recognize format changes, only data modifications. 
I imported as txt the data set that I downloaded from Kaggle, there were a total of two table files.

It is summing the volume, I do not need that, I am looking for an average, so I am going to change the measure type.
